    st.write("The platform then issues tokens tied to those assets to the depositor and returns the assets upon "

    st.write("Though Stellar borrows its ideas from Bitcoin, its main distinction from Bitcoin is that it's secured by a "

    st.write("Instead of proof-of-work, Stellar deploys the \"Stellar Consensus Protocol\" (SCP), which was invented "
             "by Stellar chief scientist David Mazi√®res in 2015. Under SC, a set group of \"trustworthy\" nodes are "
             "responsible for validating transactions and blocks, making sure no one is printing free money for themselves.")

    st.write("This set of trustworthy nodes is voted on periodically. Anyone on the network can participate by running a"
             " node. Each node votes on whom they believe is trustworthy. The winners (whoever gets the majority of votes) "
             "are responsible for validating transactions. Because SC doesn't require costly mining machines running "
             "computations all day, it's a far more eco-friendly blockchain project than other blockchains. SC is also "
             "how Stellar can support faster and cheaper transactions.")

    st.write("Still, some researchers argue that algorithms like Stellar's aren't as secure and open as Bitcoin's proof-of-work."
             "For instance, one research paper from South Korea's Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, called "
             "Stellar \"significantly centralized.\" Because of those issues, the Stellar network has crashed at least "
             "twice over the last couple of years, preventing users from sending payments across the network.")

    st.write("Jed McCaleb, a computer programmer and former chief technology officer at Ripple, left Ripple in 2013 "
             "due to a disagreement about the cryptocurrency company's proposed direction. He started Stellar by forming"
             " a new blockchain that split off from Ripple's blockchain.")
    st.write("In 2014, McCaleb launched the Stellar Development Fund in collaboration with Patrick Collison, the CEO "
             "of payment software company Stripe, and Stripe invested $3 million in Stellar. With its ambitions to "
             "compete with big remittance companies, Stellar has joined forces with several global financial "
