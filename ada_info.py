    st.write("The open-source project also aims to ‚Äúredistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to "
             "individuals‚Äù ‚Äî helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair.")
    st.write("Cardano was founded back in 2017, and named after the 16th century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano. "
             "The native ADA token takes its name from the 19th century mathematician Ada Lovelace, widely regarded as "
             "the world‚Äôs first computer programmer. The ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in "

    st.write("In August 2021, Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of the Alonzo hard fork, causing Cardano price to "
             "surge, gaining 116% in the following month. On Sept. 12, 2021, the Cardano ‚ÄòAlonzo‚Äô hard fork officially "
             "launched, bringing smart contract functionality to the blockchain. Over 100 smart contracts were deployed "
             "in the following 24 hours after the launch.")
    st.write("Cardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products "

    st.write("In an interview for CoinMarketCap‚Äôs Crypto Titans series, Hoskinson said that he got involved in "
             "cryptocurrencies back in 2011 ‚Äî and dabbled in mining and trading. He explained that his first professional "
             "involvement in the industry came in 2013, when he created a course about Bitcoin that ended up being taken "
             "by 80,000 students.")
    st.write("As well as being a technology entrepreneur, Hoskinson is also a mathematician. In 2020, his technology "

    st.write("The project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of "
             "peer-reviewed research, meaning that bold ideas can be challenged before they are validated. According to "
             "the Cardano team, this academic rigor helps the blockchain to be durable and stable ‚Äî increasing the chance "
             "that potential pitfalls can be anticipated in advance.")
    st.write("In 2020, Cardano held a Shelley upgrade that aimed to make its blockchain ‚Äú50 to 100 times more "
             "decentralized‚Äù than other large blockchains. At the time, Hoskinson predicted that this would pave the way "
             "for hundreds of assets to run on its network.")
    st.write("The Alonzo hard fork launch in September 2021 will bring an end to the Shelley era, and usher in the "
             "Goguen phase. Users can develop and deploy smart contracts on Cardano, allowing native decentralized "
